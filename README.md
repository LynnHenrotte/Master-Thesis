## Master Thesis - Lynn Henrotte 

This repository contains any code that was written during my master thesis project.

This project was completed in five work packages (WP):
- WP1: Literature review on pharmacogenomics and synthetic sequencing data
- WP2: Investigation of the extent of missing pharmacogenetic variation in current reference materials (GeT-RM and Star Allele Search)
- WP3: Qualitative comparison of several Illumina short-read simulators to select one, evaluation of simulated data (realism + variants)
- WP4: Actual simulation of all star alleles of CYP2C9 and CYP2C19 (preceeds evaluation in WP3)
- WP5: Diplotype calling on the generated dataset with Aldy, StellarPGx, and PyPGx

Due to their excessive size, several files that were created or used as input are not included in this repository. The omitted files include:
- reference sequence of chr10 in FASTA format
- (aligned) reads in FASTQ and BAM files
